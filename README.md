# Mimetic Minds


Introducing "Mimetic Minds" - a project inspired by the groundbreaking paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." 

Mimetic: relating to, characterized by, or exhibiting mimicry

The title was chosen to emphasize AI's ability to mimic human thought processes and behaviors, reflecting the core concept of the paper. Our project explores the use of large language models as generative agents to create realistic simulations of human behavior.
